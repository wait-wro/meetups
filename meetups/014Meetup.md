## ℹ️ Description

Swiss quality and precision. Skills from Wroclaw??? Why not?

We're continuing our summer journey with MedTech. This time, we have a guest from Switzerland and a local cloud whisperer! We delved into AI applications in oncology and the case of building a MedTech startup on the OVHcloud platform.

Our guests from Switzerland are eager to grow their team. Let them get to know you :)

In his talk, Robert traced how foundation models are vaulting from NLP labs into oncology and why kaiko is pushing them beyond perception into transparent reasoning at expert level.

They pre-trained billion-parameter vision-language cores on petabytes of slides, scans, clinical notes and omics, stream that data through a live harmonised evaluation harness, and aligned them in a reinforcement loop that rewards clinically coherent chains-of-thought.
Ultimately, they are establishing a continuous feedback cycle— pathologist, radiologist, and oncologists probing the model, correcting its logic, and instantaneously upgrading its policy—turning interpretability into performance gains and their models into an AI assistant for bespoke experts.

Filip's presentation was a journey, from the basic building blocks all the way up to ready-made services that can power innovation and enable businesses to create and deploy their own AI solutions. We explored the entire stack, highlighting how OVHcloud's infrastructure and services can be leveraged to build custom AI products. Featuring a real-world example from one of their customers in the healthcare business, this session provided insights into the possibilities and opportunities of AI development with OVHcloud, and how their solutions can help you bring your AI vision to life.
